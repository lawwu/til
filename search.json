    "section": "",
    "text": "Based on this WSJ article, America Has Pulled Off the Impossible. It Made Getting a Passport Simple, I learned that it’s now possible to renew your US Passport online. I thought this was too good to be true so I tried going through the process. I found out I was eligible!\nThe main points of eligibility are below. Too bad you cannot do this for kids. - The passport you are renewing is or was valid for 10 years, and you are age 25 or older.  - The passport you are renewing is either expiring within one year or has expired less than five years ago. - You are not changing your name, sex, date of birth, or place of birth. - You are not traveling for at least 6 weeks from the date you will submit your application. We will only offer routine service, and the time it takes to get a passport will be the same as renewing by mail.\nThe process was pretty easy on a phone:\n\nfill out some personal data\ntake a picture of yourself (the service will automatically crop your picture). Though it doesn’t accept HEIC images, only JPEG less than 10mb so I had to convert HEIC to JPEG and shrink it a little to upload it.\n\nThe application process was relatively pain-free and I was delightfully surprised. Gone are the days of making an appointment at a post office, paying for passport pictures. Love it.\nTimeline:\n\n2025-07-07 - Applied, Payment Pending\n2025-07-09 - U.S. Department of State has received your application. Application Status: In Process\n2025-07-10, 8pm - Approved\n2025-07-10, 10:30pm - Shipped\n2025-07-11 - Printing and preparing to give it to you. (I thought it was shipped already??)\n2025-07-15 - Received the passport in the mail!"

    "text": "From this post, I learned that Cognition, the company behind Devin created DeepWiki. They’re calling it a “Deep Research for Github.” They created explainer-wiki style web pages for the top 30,000 most popular Github repos.\nFrom Silas Alberti, he said:\n\n30k repos already indexed\nprocessed 4 billion+ lines of code\nthe indexing alone cost $300k+ in compute\n\nSome interesting points he makes in his thread:\n\nindexing a single repo costs $12 on average\nmodels are very good at understanding code locally. the hard part is understanding the global structure of the codebase.\nDeepWiki breaks down a codebase into a hierarchy of high-level systems and then generates a wiki page for every system\none interesting signal that we’re able to leverage is the commit history. who tends to touch which files together? you can represent this as a graph.\n\nYou can also do Q&A on each project after clicking into it. I looked at a handful of examples and can see how valuable this is.\nSome ones I briefly looked at:\n\nhttps://deepwiki.com/pandas-dev/pandas\nhttps://deepwiki.com/langchain-ai/langgraph\nhttps://deepwiki.com/BerriAI/litellm\nhttps://deepwiki.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol\n\nThe generated diagrams are nice: \nA lot of MCP servers are already in the top 30k repos:"

    "text": "Prompt: Intent Formulation\nsystem:\n## Task - Search Query Formulation\n- Your task is to generate search query for a user question using conversation history as context to retrieve relevant documents that can answer user\nquestion.\n- Your goal is to help answer user question by distilling the \"Current user question\" and previous question into one or few search independent queries.\n- You should generate one canonical form for each search query. You do not add variants of a search query but instead include all details in an extensive\nquery.\n- Every search query generated should be for a unique search intent by the user. Ensure the query captures all keywords from the \"Current user question\"\nwith details from chat history context.\n- Only generate multiple intents if you believe we need to query about multiple topics.\n- **Do not generate query paraphrases**.\n- If you think multiple searches are required, please generate search intent for each independent question.\n- You should also generate unified search query as part of the array.\n- Avoid making assumptions or introducing new information to the search queries, unless explicitly mentioned in the conversation history.\n## Output Format\n- You need to generate a list of search queries, which collectively can be used to retrieve documents to answer the user query.\n- user query is the \"Current user question\" or comment made by the user. It is the message before the last instruction message below.\n- They should be formatted as a list of strings. For example, a query that generates two search intent should output:\n- For a general query, respond with [\"search intent\"]. This intent should include all details and keywords required for search.\n- If user is asking about multiple topics - [\"search intent1\", \"search intent 2\", \"search intent 1+2 unified\"]\n- **You should only generate multiple intents if there are multiple things are being asked by user. If the user is asking information about a single topic,\ncreate one comprehensive query to encapsulate intent.**\n## Handle Greeting, Thanks and General Problem Solving\n- Pure Greeting: If the user's input is exclusively a greeting (e.g., 'hello', 'how are you?', 'thank you!'), return an empty array: [].\n- Greetings encompass not only salutations like \"Hi\" but also expressions of gratitude or Thanks from the user that might be the \"Current user question\".\nFor instance, if the user says \"Thanks for the help!\" after few turns, return: [].\n- Mixed Input: If the input combines a greeting/chitchat with a query (e.g., \"Hi! Can you help me tell what is &lt;Topic&gt;?\"), generate only the relevant search\nquery. For the given example, return: [\"What is &lt;Topic&gt;?\", \"tell me about &lt;Topic&gt;\"].\n- Problem-solving Questions: If the user poses a question that doesn't necessitate an information search (e.g., a specific math problem solution), return an\nempty array: []. An example might be solving am general basic mathematics equation.\n- Independent Assessment: Evaluate every user input independently to determine if it's a greeting, or a general question, regardless of the conversation\nhistory.\n## Search Query Formulation\n- Retain essential keywords and phrases from the user's query.\n- Read carefully instructions above for **handling greeting, chitchat and general problem solving** and do not generate search queries for those user\nquestions. The instructions for search query formulation change in that scenario to generate **empty array**.\n- Thoroughly read the user's message and ensure that the formulated search intents encompass all the questions they've raised.\n- If the user specifies particular details, integrate them into the search intents. Such specifics can be pivotal in obtaining accurate search results.\n- Retain the user's original phrasing in search query, as unique phrasing might be critical for certain searches.\n- Ensure you include question form in search intents. Example, include \"What\", \"Why\", \"How\" etc. based on the user query.\n- You should not add details from conversation before the \"Current user question\" unless it is obvious. User may want to change topics abruptly and you\nshould generate independent search intent for \"Current user question\" in that case.\n- While it's important to use the conversation context when crafting search intents, refrain from making unwarranted assumptions. Overloading the intent\nwith irrelevant context can skew the search results.\n- Do not include placeholder variables or request additional details. The generated search intents will be directly applied to search engines, so\nplaceholders or ambiguous details can diminish the quality of search results.\n## Search Intent - Ignoring response format request\n- Your main focus should be on formulating the search intent. Avoid paying heed to any instructions about the desired format of the response.\n- Users might specify how they want their answer presented, such as \"answer in 7 sentences\" or dictate the response language (e.g., \"Answer in\nJapanese\"). These instructions should be overlooked when crafting the search intents.\n- In this case generate search intent to answer the core question. User request for answer format does not apply here.\n## Handle Conversation History\n- Please use chat history to determine the search intent.\n- Read carefully the chat history and \"Current user question\" to determine if the user in engaging in greeting. If yes, follow the instructions above.\n- For example, if the user says \"Thanks I will use that\" at the end of conversation, you should return - [].\n- Ensure that the search query derived from the current message is self-contained. Replace pronouns like 'it', 'this', 'her' with their respective entities based\non the chat history.\n- If the search intent in the current message is unclear, default to the intent from the most recent message.\n- Disregard chat history if the topic shifted in the \"Current user question\". This does not apply if the different independent questions are asked by user.\n- If the \"Current user question\" has multiple questions, please generate search intents for all questions in a single array.\n- Always include a query for combined search intent. This extra search query will ensure we can find if a document exists that can answer question directly.\n- For example if a user asks - \"What is A, B and C?\", you should return - [\"intent A\", \"intent B\", intent C\", \"intent A, B and C\"].\n{{conversation}}\nuser:\nPlease generate search queries for the conversation above based on instructions above to help answer the \"Current user question\"."

And then I’ll drop it into ChatGPT with a prompt: “What are the main points and takeaways from this talk?”. Example here.\nAging and Disease Connection: The speaker, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, explains how age is the biggest risk factor for many diseases. As we age, cells lose their resilience or “buffer capacity,” making them more vulnerable to disease.\n\nYamanaka Factors and Cell Reprogramming: Yamanaka’s discovery of four proteins (Yamanaka factors) that can reprogram adult cells into embryonic-like stem cells plays a crucial role. The focus now is on “partial reprogramming,” where a short pulse of these factors can rejuvenate cells without causing them to lose their identity (which could otherwise lead to cancer or malfunction).\nChromatin and the Epigenome: Belmonte explains how chromatin (DNA packaging) can either be open (leading to aging and disease) or closed (correlating with health and youth). Altering the chromatin to a more closed state can rejuvenate cells and potentially reverse disease.\nApplication Beyond Mice: This rejuvenation technology has been successfully tested in mice, including fixing genetic mutations and extending the lifespan of diseased mice. The next step is to apply these findings to human cells and organs, focusing on improving their resilience to disease without altering their genome.\nPotential for Human Applications: Altos Labs aims to apply these techniques in humans, starting with ex vivo organ rejuvenation (e.g., preparing discarded organs for transplantation). The ultimate goal is to develop methods that can increase human cells’ buffer capacity, thereby extending health span and delaying or reversing aging-related diseases.\nFuture of Rejuvenation Therapies: The talk emphasizes the long-term potential of partial cell reprogramming to revolutionize human health by combating diseases linked to aging. The approach is described as a combination of cutting-edge science and industry, with billions of dollars invested in fundamental research and safe applications for human health.\nChamath asks whether lifestyle choices like exercise can slow the aging process or improve cellular buffer capacity. Belmonte reveals that the gene expression changes induced by exercise resemble those triggered by the short pulses of Yamanaka factors, showing that lifestyle interventions can have a significant impact on cellular health and longevity.\n\nI found it fascinating that cellular aging could be reversed. The easiest way we have access to that is through simple exercise which triggers gene expression changes induced by short pulses of Yamanka factors!"

    "text": "We’ve been expecting OpenAI to release something about agents for awhile now and we finally got that release today.\nOpenAI enters the arena with a new Responses API and Agents SDK. They’re labeling this SDK as the production-level version of their previous framework Swarm.\nOpenAI’s Agent Framework can work with other LLM providers using the OpenAI Chat Completions format (another plus for proxies like LiteLLM).\nThree general categories of tools they call out:\n\nHosted tools: these run on LLM servers alongside the AI models. OpenAI offers retrieval, web search and computer use as hosted tools.\nFunction calling: these allow you to use any Python function as a tool.\nAgents as tools: this allows you to use an agent as a tool, allowing Agents to call other agents without handing off to them.\n\nKind of cool how they are turning Python functions into Agent tools:\n\nThe Agents SDK will setup the tool automatically:\nThe name of the tool will be the name of the Python function (or you can provide a name)\nTool description will be taken from the docstring of the function (or you can provide a description)\nThe schema for the function inputs is automatically created from the function’s arguments\nDescriptions for each input are taken from the docstring of the function, unless disabled\nWe use Python’s inspect module to extract the function signature, along with griffe to parse docstrings and pydantic for schema creation.\n\n\nOther notes I took from watching the above release video:\nOpenAI has a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o that they use to review search results that are coming back from the Search tool in ChatGPT. It out performs o3-mini and gpt-4.5 on SimpleQA. This model is used in the Search tool they are making available.\n\n\n\nSimpleQA Benchmark\n\n\nOther tools are a File Search tool and Computer Use tool (which it sounded like also has a different fine-tuned CUA model?). Actually yes, there is a computer use model. One of them is computer-use-preview-2025-02-04 (see here).\nThey’re also releasing a Responses API. OpenAI released the Chat Completions API in March 2023 with gpt-3.5-turbo. It will be interesting if this Responses API becomes the de-facto standard like Chat Completions has. They will continue to support Chat Completions but Responses API will be a superset of Completions API features.\nThe Assistants API will eventually be deprecated sometime in 2026."

    "text": "OpenAI added a system prompt generate button that lets you generate prompts, functions and schemas from just describing the task.\nThey use “meta-prompts” and “meta-schemas” to do this.\nThey also say they may use more advanced techniques like DSPy and Gradient Descent.\nThe meta prompt is quite instructive. It’s awesome they’ve open sourced this. I’ve started to use LLMs to generate prompts too. Of course I will then modify what the LLM generates for my specific use case and run some evaluations. Language models generally do a better job than I do at being comprehensive on the first pass of a use case. This is because I and other humans are forgetful and not as thorough as a well-prompted language model, this idea reminds me of a study that said 80% of ChatGPT’s answers were better than a physician. This is not to say humans will not write better prompts than a language model will. But once you’ve done a task multiple times, you may not be as thorough, rush through and not have time to do robust prompt engineering.\nBelow are two meta-prompt examples and two meta-schema examples."

There is already ggml versions available here.\n\nggml-large-v3-turbo.bin\nggml-large-v3-turbo-q5_0.bin\n\nHuggingFace has a model card here. There’s a Github discussion here talking about the model. It’s basically a distilled version of large-v3:\nWe’re releasing a new Whisper model named large-v3-turbo, or turbo for short. It is an optimized version of Whisper large-v3 and has only 4 decoder layers—just like the tiny model—down from the 32 in the large series.\n\nThis work is inspired by Distil-Whisper, where the authors observed that using a smaller decoder can greatly improve transcription speed while causing minimal degradation in accuracy. Unlike Distil-Whisper, which used distillation to train a smaller model, Whisper turbo was fine-tuned for two more epochs over the same amount of multilingual transcription data used for training large-v3, i.e. excluding translation data, on which we don’t expect turbo to perform well.\n\nAcross languages, the turbo model performs similarly to large-v2, though it shows larger degradation on some languages like Thai and Cantonese. Whisper turbo performs better on FLEURS, which consists of cleaner recordings than Common Voice. The figure below shows the turbo model’s performance on the subset of languages in the Common Voice 15 and FLEURS datasets where large-v3 scored a 20% error rate or lower.\nI started using this model in my transcripts repo."

    "title": "src layout vs flat layout in Python projects",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I haven’t seen these terms “src layout” and “flat layout” before when referring to Python project conventions that put source code in either a top level folder that is the package name or nesting it under a src/ folder. This article provides a lot of detail and actually some reasons why a src/ layout is probably better. Also reading this Overview of Python Packaging was very informative too.\nQuoting the article:\nThe “flat layout” refers to organising a project’s files in a folder or repository, such that the various configuration files and import packages are all in the top-level directory.\n.\n├── README.md\n├── noxfile.py\n├── pyproject.toml\n├── setup.py\n├── awesome_package/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   └── module.py\n└── tools/\n    ├── generate_awesomeness.py\n    └── decrease_world_suck.py\nThe “src layout” deviates from the flat layout by moving the code that is intended to be importable (i.e. import awesome_package, also known as import packages) into a subdirectory. This subdirectory is typically named src/, hence “src layout”.\n.\n├── README.md\n├── noxfile.py\n├── pyproject.toml\n├── setup.py\n├── src/\n│    └── awesome_package/\n│       ├── __init__.py\n│       └── module.py\n└── tools/\n    ├── generate_awesomeness.py\n    └── decrease_world_suck.py\nHere’s a breakdown of the important behaviour differences between the src layout and the flat layout:\n\nThe src layout requires installation of the project to be able to run its code, and the flat layout does not.\n\nThis means that the src layout involves an additional step in the development workflow of a project (typically, an editable installation is used for development and a regular installation is used for testing).\n\nThe src layout helps prevent accidental usage of the in-development copy of the code.\n\nThis is relevant since the Python interpreter includes the current working directory as the first item on the import path. This means that if an import package exists in the current working directory with the same name as an installed import package, the variant from the current working directory will be used. This can lead to subtle misconfiguration of the project’s packaging tooling, which could result in files not being included in a distribution.\nThe src layout helps avoid this by keeping import packages in a directory separate from the root directory of the project, ensuring that the installed copy is used.\n\nThe src layout helps enforce that an editable installation is only able to import files that were meant to be importable.\n\nThis is especially relevant when the editable installation is implemented using a path configuration file that adds the directory to the import path.\nThe flat layout would add the other project files (eg: README.md, tox.ini) and packaging/tooling configuration files (eg: setup.py, noxfile.py) on the import path. This would make certain imports work in editable installations but not regular installations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Some takeaways from reading Anthropic’s fantastic post on How we built our multi-agent research system. This is Simon Willison’s thoughts on the post too. I can tell it’s written by someone or a team that has spent time in the trenches building and architecting this system.\nThese two diagrams were helpful. I’ve been seeing these process diagrams more. I wonder if it’s because AI can generate these diagrams easily and so developers are including them in documentation more.\n\n\n\nHigh-Level Architecture\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Diagram\n\n\nSome learnings: - Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are good for breadth-first search queries - MAS work because they spend enough tokens to solve the problem - increased token usage explained 80% of the variance - MAS are much more expensive: agents use 4x more tokens than chats and Multi-Agent systems us 15x more tokens than chats - I learned about Interleaved thinking - which enables Claude to think between tool calls and make more sophisticated reasoning after receiving tool results. Google’s Gemini 2.5 models also do this. - Prompt Engineering is still massively important in creating Multi-Agent systems - prompting the orchestrator to delegate well - “Agent-tool interfaces are as critical as human-computer interfaces. Using the right tool is efficient—often, it’s strictly necessary. For instance, an agent searching the web for context that only exists in Slack is doomed from the start. With MCP servers that give the model access to external tools, this problem compounds, as agents encounter unseen tools with descriptions of wildly varying quality. We gave our agents explicit heuristics: for example, examine all available tools first, match tool usage to user intent, search the web for broad external exploration, or prefer specialized tools over generic ones. Bad tool descriptions can send agents down completely wrong paths, so each tool needs a distinct purpose and a clear description.”” - Thought this tool-testing agent was cool “Let agents improve themselves. We found that the Claude 4 models can be excellent prompt engineers. When given a prompt and a failure mode, they are able to diagnose why the agent is failing and suggest improvements. We even created a tool-testing agent—when given a flawed MCP tool, it attempts to use the tool and then rewrites the tool description to avoid failures. By testing the tool dozens of times, this agent found key nuances and bugs. This process for improving tool ergonomics resulted in a 40% decrease in task completion time for future agents using the new description, because they were able to avoid most mistakes.””\nThey also have a section on Evaluations that was helpful:\n\nStarting evals with small samples\n“We experimented with multiple judges to evaluate each component, but found that a single LLM call with a single prompt outputting scores from 0.0-1.0 and a pass-fail grade was the most consistent and aligned with human judgements.””\nStill having human evals after implementing automated LLM-as-judge evals"

    "text": "I learned today how to create slides programatically using Quarto & revealjs. Quarto’s documentation is wonderful and their Revealjs documentation is no different.\nThis is an example of a slideshow with two slides:\n---\ntitle: \"Habits\"\nauthor: \"John Doe\"\nformat: revealjs\n---\n\n## Getting up\n\n- Turn off alarm\n- Get out of bed\n\n## Going to sleep\n\n- Get in bed\n- Count sheep\nThis is an example of a more complicated slidedeck.\nSome benefits:\n\nthey are in code, no more manual work rearranging images/text in Powerpoint\nthe default slides look nice\ncan be version controlled\ncode snippets are very nicely rendered and scrollable"
