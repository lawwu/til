I learned recently you can use uv to install Python. Likely will use uv instead of `pyenv` to install and manage Python versions going forward.

There also seems to be a tipping point where it is moving from the tool you would use to install requirements with `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` to the all-in-one tool to install Python, manage dependencies and setup your Python project too.

Some project templates that look interesting:

- [simple-modern-uv](https://github.com/jlevy/simple-modern-uv)
- [cookiecutter-uv](https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-uv)
- [copier-uv](https://github.com/pawamoy/copier-uv)


I also learned about [copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) which is a format templates can follow which allows you to [pull future changes to the template](https://github.com/jlevy/simple-modern-uv#updating-your-project-template) back into your project.
