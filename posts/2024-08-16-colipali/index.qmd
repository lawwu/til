Learned about ColiPali via [Twitter/X](https://x.com/tonywu_71/status/1824194413469503764?s=12).

- Demo: <https://huggingface.co/spaces/manu/ColPali-demo>
- Model: <https://huggingface.co/vidore/colpali>
- Then in September 2024, Ben Clavie released the [`byaldi`](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/byaldi) to make it easier to use ColiPali models. Haven't used it yet but it sounds like the equivalent of what [RAGatouille](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/RAGatouille) did for [ColBERT](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT).
