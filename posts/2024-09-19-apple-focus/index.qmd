Focus modes on Apple devices (iOS and MacOS) are useful. You can configure these to allow notifications from certain people and/or apps when the
focus mode is on (e.g. allow notifications from a spouse and/or calls from your Favorites). You can also schedule these modes for example to turn on
during working hours.

See these instructions for iOS (but will be available anywhere you are signed into your Apple account): <https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/set-up-a-focus-iphd6288a67f/ios>
