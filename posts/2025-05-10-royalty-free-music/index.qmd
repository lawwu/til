YouTube really is such an amazing resource. I make home videos and sometimes need background music. This playlist called [Upbeat No Copyright Music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7pkSK1xbGD6g2_BSXgScugMC1CJkkdBW) has provided some great background music for some of my videos.

You can use [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download the playlist:

```bash
yt-dlp https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7pkSK1xbGD6g2_BSXgScugMC1CJkkdBW
```

But this will download the videos which are unnecessary. To download only mp3s, you can use this command:

```bash
yt-dlp -f bestaudio --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 --audio-quality 0 -o "%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s" https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7pkSK1xbGD6g2_BSXgScugMC1CJkkdBW
```
