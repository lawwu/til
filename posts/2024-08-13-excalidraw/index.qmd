I didn't realize [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) was open source. Heard about it a year ago from a presentation.

- Github: <https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw>
- VS Code Extension: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor>
- just need to create a new file with a .excalidraw extension and open it. Excalidraw saves data in JSON.

Also a list of public libraries/extensions: <https://libraries.excalidraw.com/>
