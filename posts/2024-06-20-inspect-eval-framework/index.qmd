Hamel Hussain finished hosting an LLM conference. All of the talks are listed [here](https://parlance-labs.com/education/). One of the talks was from JJ Allaire, the creator of RStudio. I owe RStudio and all of the open source R developers like [Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz/) a lot of credit as it jump started my data science career. His [tidy data paper](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) (and now [chapter in his book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)) was really helpful to frame how to structure data.

That talk is here:

One thing that is also cool is he [used Quarto to create slides in code](https://github.com/jjallaire/inspect-llm-workshop/blob/main/slides/inspect.qmd) (something I'd like to do going forward instead of manually creating powerpoint slides).
