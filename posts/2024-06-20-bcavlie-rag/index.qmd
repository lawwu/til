Hamel Hussain finished hosting an LLM conference. All of the talks are listed [here](https://parlance-labs.com/education/). One of the best talks was from Benjamin Clavie. I first heard about him because he's the author of the great [RAGatouille](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/RAGatouille) library that made ColBERT embeddings much easier to work with.

That talk is here:

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nA5QG3087g&t=1s&ab_channel=HamelHusain >}}

He made a post about it here: <https://parlance-labs.com/education/rag/ben.html>

The most important slide was showing what a really strong baseline RAG implementatoin will use as of June 2024.

- a strong embedding model like `bge-small-en-v1.5` to do the bi-encoding
- a Vector Database (he recommends LanceDB)
- creating full text search (with tf-idf)
- using a reranker like one from Cohere. Ben maintains the [`rerankers`](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/rerankers) library.

I made the code runnable in this [gist](https://github.com/lawwu/rag_benchmarking/blob/main/rag_mvp.py): 

```python

# Fetch some text content in two different categories
from wikipediaapi import Wikipedia
wiki = Wikipedia('RAGBot/0.0', 'en')
docs = [{"text": x,
         "category": "person"}
        for x in wiki.page('Hayao_Miyazaki').text.split('\n\n')]
docs += [{"text": x,
         "category": "film"}
         for x in wiki.page('Spirited_Away').text.split('\n\n')]

# Enter LanceDB
import lancedb
from lancedb.pydantic import LanceModel, Vector
from lancedb.embeddings import get_registry

# Initialise the embedding model
model_registry = get_registry().get("sentence-transformers")
model = model_registry.create(name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5")

# Create a Model to store attributes for filtering
class Document(LanceModel):
    text: str = model.SourceField()
    vector: Vector(384) = model.VectorField()
    category: str

db = lancedb.connect(".my_db")
tbl = db.create_table("my_table", schema=Document)

# Embed the documents and store them in the database
tbl.add(docs)

# Generate the full-text (tf-idf) search index
tbl.create_fts_index("text")

# Initialise a reranker -- here, Cohere's API one
# reranker = CohereReranker()

query = "What is Chihiro's new name given to her by the witch?"

results = (tbl.search(query, query_type="hybrid") # Hybrid means text + vector
.where("category = 'film'", prefilter=True) # Restrict to only docs in the 'film' category
.limit(10) # Get 10 results from first-pass retrieval
# .rerank(reranker=reranker) # For the reranker to compute the final ranking
          )

df_results = results.to_pandas()

print(df_results)
