I started using [Hyprnote](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote) a [couple weeks ago](https://lawwu.github.io/til/posts/2025-08-05-hyprnote-transcribe-meetings/). I've found it useful transcribing meetings so I do not need to take copius notes since I can always rely on the transcript.

I learned today you can export the Hyprnote AI Summary and full transcript to Obsidian.

To do this:

- Install the community plugin [local REST API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) for Obsidian
- Click the checkbox to "Enable Non-Encrypted HTTP Server", copy the API Key
- In Hypernote --> Settings --> Integrations tab --> paste the API Key. You can also configure the folder these notes to a specific Obsidian folder.
- In Hypernote --> From any note, you can click Share and you should see the notes exported to Obsidian.
