To install:

```bash
# on a M series Mac
# brew install rust
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install moshi_mlx
# run moshi (will download the quantized model) and you can chat with it
python -m moshi_mlx.local -q 4
```

I setup this up on two laptops and recorded Moshi talking to Moshi (after seeding it with a topic on basketball):
