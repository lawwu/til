I was granted access to Github Copilot Workspace. It's Github's AI Coding Assistant built into Github.com where you can go from Github Issue to a Pull Request. I tried it, it's pretty cool. The PR the service generated in my [transcripts](https://github.com/lawwu/transcripts) repo is [here](https://github.com/lawwu/transcripts/pull/3). The workspace is viewable [here](https://copilot-workspace.githubnext.com/lawwu/transcripts/issues/2?shareId=685875ce-8d8a-4c54-9376-f58bd34f89fe).

The workflow is:

## 1. Create an Issue

## 2. Agent will create a spec

That you can edit

## 3. Agent will create a plan

The agent creates a plans of what files will be edited according to your spec.

## 4. Agent will create commits

The agent then creates commits and a pull request! There's also a chat interface to make revisions which is cool.
