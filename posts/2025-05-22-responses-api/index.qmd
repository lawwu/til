OpenAI's Responses API is becoming an Agent API from Steven Heidel's [tweet](https://x.com/stevenheidel/status/1925209983073046616

Pretty interesting how OpenAI is moving up the stack where with an API call you can basically configure a tool calling [ReAct agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629). Over the last year, agent framework SDKs like LangGraph provide utilities to [create react agents](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/agents/langchain.agents.react.agent.create_react_agent.html). Now with the Responses API, you can create this tool calling agent that can call remote MCP servers, code interpreter, RAG, image generation and we search tools natively.
