Simon Willison coined a new term called the [lethal trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/). As someone that uses AI every day and has been experimenting with MCP Servers in the last few months, I was surprised at the new attack vectors that MCP Servers unlock.

The lethal trifecta is to quote Simon:

- **Access to your private data** — one of the most common purposes of tools in the first place!
- **Exposure to untrusted content** — any mechanism by which text (or images) controlled by a malicious attacker could become available to your LLM
- **The ability to externally communicate** in a way that could be used to steal your data (I often call this “exfiltration” but I’m not confident that term is widely understood.)

Github's MCP server [exploit from May 2025](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/26/github-mcp-exploited/) is an example of this.
