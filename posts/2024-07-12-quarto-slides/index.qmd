I learned today how to create slides programatically using Quarto & revealjs. Quarto's documentation is wonderful and their [Revealjs documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) is no different.

This is an example of a slideshow with two slides:

```markdown
---
title: "Habits"
author: "John Doe"
format: revealjs
---

## Getting up

- Turn off alarm
- Get out of bed

## Going to sleep

- Get in bed
- Count sheep
```

This is an [example](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/blob/main/docs/presentations/revealjs/demo/index.qmd) of a more complicated slidedeck.

Some benefits:

- they are in code, no more manual work rearranging images/text in Powerpoint
- the default slides look nice
- can be version controlled
- code snippets are very nicely rendered and scrollable
