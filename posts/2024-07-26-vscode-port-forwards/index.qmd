Today I ran into this issue where I wasn't able to call some Azure Functions I was developing locally. When Remote SSH'ing into a VM using VS Code, if you start a webserver on that machine, the port is automatically forwarded to your machine's localhost. Since my webserver was using the same port 7072, and forward to `localhost:7072`, the Azure Functions running locally also at `localhost:7072` were not accessible since calls to that address were being sent to the webserver (via the port forward).

Clicking the Ports tab in VS Code shows the port being Auto Forwarded:
