Today I learned, [Posit](https://posit.co/) (use to be RStudio) is working on a new data science IDE that looks like RStudio built on the same underlying code as VS Code: <https://github.com/posit-dev/positron> built on Code OSS.

Also learned that "Code OSS" is another name for VS Code: <https://github.com/microsoft/vscode>.
