[python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) is a ridiculously helpful Python library to programatically load environment variables you have in a `.env` file into your script and Jupyter notebooks. 
 
Install it:
```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

Put this code block at the top of scripts or notebooks:
```bash
from dotenv import load_dotenv
# find .env automagically by walking up directories until it's found
dotenv_path = find_dotenv()
# load up the entries as environment variables
load_dotenv(dotenv_path)
 ```

If you want to load .env into your shell environment programmatically, you can run:
 
```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
```

This is helpful when a Streamlit app or FastAPI application needs .env variables.

If you want zsh to do this automatically every time a new shell session is opened, you can use this [plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/dotenv).
